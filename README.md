# 100-Days-Of-SwiftUI
Daily SwiftUI learning for 100 days - skill refresh & public accountability

Course: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

**Note:** Beginning at Day 16 (Project 1). Days 1–15 covered Swift basics, so they aren’t included here.

## Plan  
- At least one commit per weekday

- Each day includes:  
  1. Code (if applicable)  
  2. Notes on what I learned  
  3. Link to at least one educational Youtube video + brief summary  

## Structure  
Each day has its own folder:  
 
```shell
DayX/
├── Code/     # Swift code for the day
└── Notes.md  # What I learned + Youtube links
```

## Structure  
- `ProjectXX-Name/` → SwiftUI project
- `Notes/` → Daily reflections + Youtube link(s)
