# Day 18

## 100 Days of SwiftUI

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/18

Very simple day, just needed to make enhancements to the existing project.. many of which I had already included. I simply needed to change my `Picker` to have a `.navigationLink` style, and used a `0..<101` `Range` in my `ForEach` to have more possible tip percentages.

I got through videos 15-17 today:

15. How to use For Loops in Swift
16. How to Filter, Sort, and Map in Swift
17. What is a Protocol in Swift and SwiftUI View protocol

- Honestly I had forgotten that a `Repeat-While` was a thing in Swift!

...and unfortunately that's about it. The rest was a brief overview on loops, using higher-order functions, and what a protocol is. Basic stuff!

This completes the Swift Basics series! Looking forward to moving on to some more complex topics where I have more to take away.
